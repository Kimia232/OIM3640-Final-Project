# OIM3640-Final-Project
Kimia and Vicky Final Project for OIM3640

## The Application: 
As college students, we are aware of the drinking habits of our peers and we wanted to provide adults of legal drinking age the opportunity to discover cocktails based on personal taste preferences or available ingredients. By providing the exact measurements to the user's desired cocktails, it helps people make safe, informed, and enjoyable choices when consuming alcohol. The app also helps to promote moderation and awareness by providing information on alcohol content.


## User Instructions for the Website:

As the legal drinking age in the United States is 21 years old, our project verifies that users meet the criteria. The website first prompts the user to enter their birthday.

If the website calculates that their age is below the age of 21, a simple message shows up informing the user that they're too young.

If the website calculates the user to be of legal age, the user is taken to the next page that displays the "Cocktail of the Day".

For a more specific search, scroll down and choose whether you want to search by a particular drink name or certain ingredient (choices are given for different types of alcohol).

Once you hit the enter button, the search results will appear. If you chose to search by the drink name, all cocktails with that name in the database will show up with a picture, the ingredients needed to make the drink, and clear and concise instructions on how to make the drink.

If you want to search for a different drink, there is a "Return to Home" button at the bottom of the website and start again.
