**The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal. **

For our project, we want to create a website that will help people find apartments/homes for rent that fit many of their largest requirements that would make the process of entering a yearlong commitment easier. We are going through this process currently, along with many of our friends around us, and it can be stressful trying to find housing that fits multiple criteria, especially if you are living with multiple people. Ideally, we would set up the common factors that people consider when they are searching for an apartment/house. This would include things like rent prices based on gross yearly income, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location and its relativity to the person’s office, parking and square footage. The user will be able to fill out a survey based on these items and the website should return options that would work for them based on what their preferred living situation is or provide them with a response if it may be unreasonable. 

Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals. 

Vicky: My individual goal with this project is to use this to hone many of the skills that we have been learning throughout the whole course in a way that creates a usable and helpful project. I would also like to experiment with html beyond some of the basics that we learned in class. From the short time that we spent on it in class, I think it is an application that I would enjoy, and this provides me with an opportunity to develop those skills. 

Kimia: This class was particularly challenging for me because learning python was a larger learning curve than I thought. With all of the exercises we have done, as well as the functions we’ve learned, I wanted to implement those learnings to a bigger project that I plan and execute from start to finish. This is a project where we put the puzzle pieces of the semester together, and apply the functions to a real world problem. 

**Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further. **

For our project, it is heavily reliant on us finding the right API that provides all of the information we need, specifically with apartment data in Boston, such as rent, location, number of rooms, etc..). we will first develop the front end that will most likely be similar to the form layout that we created in class. Once we find a suitable API, we will connect it to the back end to obtain the correct and accurate results. 

**Project Schedule: You have roughly 4-5 weeks to complete the project. Create a general timeline. Depending on your project, this could be a detailed schedule or just an overview. As the project progresses, you’ll likely need to revise this schedule. **

May 3rd Deadline – 3 weeks 

April 13th to 15th 

This weekend we will both spend time searching different APIs that would work for the project we are planning. Based on the available APIs, we will adjust the project to fit the information. For example, if only certain information is available for the  

April 15th – April 21st 

This will start with a team meeting to align our goals for the project and ensure we are envisioning the same idea for the front end. This will allow us to divide the work so that one of us can mainly focus on the front end, while the other person begins the back end. We will be available to help each other and ask questions as needed. At the end of this week, there should be a basic idea for the front end that we will return to at the end of the project to refine. Meanwhile, the person working on the back end will be setting up the API key and all of the starting programming that will lead into the next week. 

April 22nd- April 27 

Once both foundational items are created, we will work together to start developing the back end that will take the user input to bring in information from the API and make sure that all the input is valid.  

**Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure. **

We plan to follow an agile structure, meeting ~ 2 times per week to share any deliverables/findings, and address any roadblocks we face. We both plan to work on the front and back end part, while collectively searching for an applicable API. We have a shared folder on OneDrive, as well as WhatsApp phone number to maintain communication. 

**Risks and Limitations: What do you think is the biggest risk to the success of your project? **

The biggest foreseeable risk that we might face in this project is finding a free and accessible API that would provide us with all the information we need. This project is heavily reliant on us being able to find the right API and we may have to adjust the project based on what’s available to us in terms of obtaining API keys that won’t cost us any money. 

Additional Course Content: Are there any course topics or content you think would be helpful for your project? 

We think that based on what we’ve learned in class thus far, we have the right tools to get started on the project.
